# Usage: git qparent [rev]
#
# Like |hg qparent|, gives last common revision between |rev| and upstream.  If
# |rev| is not given, we let rev equal HEAD.
#
# The upstream branch is set via git branch --set-upstream <branch> <upstream>.
# If no upstream branch has been explicitly set, we use origin/master.
